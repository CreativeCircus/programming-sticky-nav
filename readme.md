# Sticky Nav project

Download the project, and look at the main JS and CSS/SCSS files to see what you're meant to be doing.

## Summary

Sometimes a website has a big header, but when you scroll down a bit, it shrinks and sticks to the top of the window, with a new layout. In this assignment, you'll learn how to do that, and you'll experiment with the design of the experience.
